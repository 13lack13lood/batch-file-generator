# batch-file-generator
batch file generator for Ms. Strelkovska's class\
**you need java btw**

## If you are on windows
just download both the .bat file and the .java file and run the .bat file

## If you are on mac or linux
just put the file in some project on eclipse and run it from there
or you can make your own bash file
do what ever you want i only support windows LOL

hope this helps
